split dataset into an array of datasets at each time

list in R

to JSON

comes out, and load it into the html object

use timer to move time (after every thousand miliseconds, run this function)


1. Make svg canvas, by hand
- grab the png file from Google Map and stick into the canvas as a background

Take first element of the list and call .data(D[0], function (d, i))
start appending a circle for each fish (.append('circle')
.attr('cx', function (d, i)))
.attr(color, function(d, i))

have to do an enter for any new guy
regular selection
and move them with a transition

Adding paths: as you're looping over in the regular selection, you'll say 'draw me a new line btween the current position and where I want to go through'

timer:

sel = data(new data)
sel.enter(new datapoints)
sel.move them (different selection)


Radio button for 
Event handlers - on click, = check'
change the data to sturgeon or to salmon
.data()
.fitler(salmoN)
.set visibility to off

Filter will always be in the code and when the box is checked it will set a variable that will be on by default, but will filter out different guys on click
